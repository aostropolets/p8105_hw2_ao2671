## Problem 1

``` r
# Importing Mr. Trash Wheel dataset with omitting non-data entries and rows without dumpster-specific data, 
# cleaning column names, rounding sports balls and converting them to integers.
trash_data = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
  sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
  range = "A2:N370") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls)) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls))
```

``` r
# Importing precipitation data for 2017 and 2018 years omitting the rows without precipitation data. 
# Also adding year
precipitation_2017 =
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation", 
    range = "A2:B14") %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(month) %>% 
    mutate(year = 2017) 

precipitation_2018 =
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation", 
    range = "A2:B14") %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(month) %>% 
    mutate(year = 2018)

# combining two sets together with a helper dataframe
month_df = 
  tibble(
    month = 1:12,
    month_name = month.name
  )

precipitation_17_and_18 =
bind_rows(precipitation_2017,precipitation_2018)
left_join(precipitation_17_and_18, month_df, by = "month")
```

    ## # A tibble: 24 x 4
    ##    month total  year month_name
    ##    <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     
    ##  1     1  2.34  2017 January

    ##  6     6  1.4   2017 June      
    ##  7     7  7.09  2017 July      
    ##  8     8  4.44  2017 August    
    ##  9     9  1.95  2017 September

    ## # … with 14 more rows

Mr. Trash Wheel dataset consists of 314 records about 314 dumpsters. It
describes collection of trash in different years (from 2014-05-16 to
2018-12-20). It describes how much trash in tons and in cubic yards was
collected by each dumpster at a given date with various types of trash:
bottles, cigarette butts, grocery bags, etc. In total, Mr. Trash Wheel
collected 1029.97 tons of trash, which is an equivalent of 4898 cubic
yards of trash. The median number of sports balls pulled from dumpsters
in 2017 was 8. Precipitation dataset contains the information about 24
precipitation in 2017 and 2018, with 32.93 total precipitation in 2017
and 70.33 total precipitation in 2018.

## Problem 2

``` r
# Importing and cleaning transit data
transit_data = 
  read_csv(
    "./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",
    col_types = cols(
      Route8 = col_character(),
      Route9 = col_character(),
      Route10 = col_character(),
      Route11 = col_character())) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select( line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1:route11, entrance_type ,entry, vending, ada) %>% 
  mutate( entry = recode (entry, "YES" = TRUE,"NO" = FALSE)) %>%
  mutate( vending = recode (vending, "YES" = TRUE,"NO" = FALSE))
```

NYC transit dataset consists of 1868 records about 356 stations. It
contains information about station latitude and longitude, routes
served, entrance and exit info etc. To clean it up, I selected only
needed variables, converted YES/NO variables into logical variables
and.. The dimensions of the dataset are 1868 and 19. The dataset isn’t
tidy.

There are 465 stations. 84 stations are ADA compliant. The proportion of
station entrances without vending but allowing entrance is 0.3770492.

``` r
# Reformatting transit data so that route number and route name are distinct variables.
transit_cleaned =
  transit_data %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_number",
    names_prefix = "route",#cut column namesv
    values_to = "route_line") %>% 
  relocate("route_line") %>% 
  drop_na(route_line)
```

There are 60 distinct stations that serve the A train. Out of them, 17
are ada compliant.
